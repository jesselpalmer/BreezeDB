# Contributing to BreezeDB

Thank you for your interest in contributing to BreezeDB! We welcome contributions from the community.

## Development Setup

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BreezeDB.git
cd BreezeDB
```

2. **Install dependencies**

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Build the project**

```bash
npm run build
```

## Development Workflow

### Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

```bash
# Type checking
npm run type-check

# Linting
npm run lint
npm run lint:fix  # Auto-fix issues

# Formatting
npm run format
npm run format:check

# Run all quality checks
npm run check
```

### Testing

```bash
# Run tests
npm test

# Run full CI pipeline
npm run test:ci
```

### Building

```bash
# Build TypeScript
npm run build

# Watch mode for development
npm run build:watch
```

## Code Style

- **TypeScript**: All new code should be written in TypeScript
- **ESLint**: Follow the configured ESLint rules
- **Prettier**: Code is automatically formatted with Prettier
- **Imports**: Use ES6 imports/exports
- **Types**: Provide proper type annotations

```

## Guidelines

### Adding New Features

- Ensure backward compatibility
- Add comprehensive tests
- Update README.md with examples
- Update TypeScript types
- Consider performance implications

### Bug Fixes

- Include a test case that reproduces the bug
- Fix the bug
- Verify the test now passes
- Update documentation if the bug affected documented behavior

### Performance Improvements

- Include benchmarks showing the improvement
- Ensure no breaking changes
- Test with various data sizes

## Testing Guidelines

- Write unit tests for new functionality
- Test edge cases and error conditions
- Include integration tests for complex features
- Ensure tests are deterministic and fast

## Documentation

- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Add JSDoc comments for new public methods
- Include code examples for new features
- Update TypeScript types and interfaces

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass and code quality checks pass
2. Update documentation
3. Write a clear PR description explaining the changes
4. Link any related issues
5. Be responsive to feedback during review

## Pre-commit Hooks

We use Husky and lint-staged to run checks before commits:

- TypeScript compilation
- ESLint
- Prettier formatting
- Tests (on push)

If pre-commit hooks fail, fix the issues before committing.

## Release Process

Releases are handled by maintainers:

1. Version bump in package.json
2. Update CHANGELOG.md
3. Create release tag
4. GitHub Actions handles npm publishing

## Getting Help

- Check existing issues and discussions
- Create a new issue for bugs or feature requests
- Join discussions in existing issues
- Contact maintainers for guidance

## Code of Conduct

- Be respectful and inclusive
- Help others learn and grow
- Focus on constructive feedback
- Maintain a professional tone
